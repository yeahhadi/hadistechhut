            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We strive to make technology more accessible by helping people repair rather than replace their devices. Whether it's a cracked screen, a dead battery, or a custom PC build, we take pride in restoring function and performance with every repair. We treat every customer like family—because for us, Dearborn is home.</p>

            <h3>Our Roles</h3>
            <p><strong>Hadi Elhaouli</strong> is the lead technician and founder of Hadi's TechHut. With a background in electronics and computer science, Hadi ensures every repair is handled with care and precision. From diagnosing motherboard issues to optimizing device performance, Hadi is hands-on with every service.</p>

            <p><strong>Talal Elhaouli</strong> supports operations with logistics, customer service, and tech support. Talal's commitment to excellence keeps our workflow efficient and our clients happy. He's the go-to for scheduling, diagnostics, and making sure every client gets their device back better than before.</p>
