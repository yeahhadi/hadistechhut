                <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
                <p> According to Wassim Nahle, a software engineer at GM, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the automotive industry, particularly in areas like autonomous driving and predictive maintenance. AI enables vehicles to process sensor data in real-time, allowing for faster, safer decision-making. Nahle foresees AI playing an even larger role in the future, especially in handling complex simulations during vehicle design. This could significantly reduce development times and enhance safety features, making vehicles more efficient and reliable, while also improving the overall driving experience.</p>

                <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. As technology evolves, so do the threats, making cybersecurity a crucial aspect of computer science. From data breaches to ransomware attacks, organizations must implement strong defense mechanisms to secure sensitive information. Cybersecurity experts use cryptographic techniques, firewalls, and security protocols to mitigate risks. One key area is ethical hacking, where professionals simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities. With the rise of IoT devices and cloud computing, the demand for cybersecurity professionals continues to grow, as companies aim to safeguard their assets from sophisticated cyber threats.</p>

                <h2>Data Science</h2>
                <p>Data Science combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of data. In an age where data is considered "the new oil," industries use data analytics to drive business strategies, optimize operations, and predict future trends. Data scientists work with tools such as Python, R, and SQL to clean, analyze, and visualize data. Machine learning models are often applied to automate decision-making processes. Data Science is essential in fields like marketing, healthcare, and finance, where data-driven decisions offer a competitive edge. Privacy concerns and ethical considerations regarding data usage are critical topics in the field</p>
