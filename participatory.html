        <h2>Hackathons: </h2>
        <p>Hackathons are collaborative coding events where developers, designers, and engineers come together to build projects or solve challenges within a set timeframe, usually 24 to 48 hours. Participants form teams, brainstorm ideas, and work intensively to develop innovative solutions or prototypes. Hackathons foster creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. They often focus on themes like sustainability, healthcare, or AI and provide a competitive yet collaborative environment, encouraging both beginners and experts to contribute their knowledge.</p>
       
        <h3>Open-Source Projects</h3>
        <p>Open-source projects like Linux allow anyone to contribute to the development and improvement of software. Developers worldwide collaborate by writing code, fixing bugs, and adding new features to these publicly available projects. The community-driven model provides transparency, security, and scalability, as code contributions are reviewed by peers. These projects not only build valuable software but also provide contributors with hands-on experience, networking opportunities, and a sense of ownership and contribution to something larger.</p>
       
        <h4>Coding Competitions</h4>
        <p>Codeforces is an online platform that hosts competitive programming contests where participants solve complex algorithmic problems in real-time. Competitors are ranked based on their speed and accuracy in solving the challenges. These competitions help programmers improve their coding skills, learn new algorithms, and think critically under pressure. Many companies also use competitive programming platforms like Codeforces to scout talent for software engineering and algorithm-heavy roles.</p>
