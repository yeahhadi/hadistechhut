                <h2>Industry Watch: Right-to-Repair Laws Expanding</h2>
                <p>Recent changes in U.S. legislation are shifting in favor of right-to-repair laws, which give consumers and independent repair shops like ours greater access to parts, tools, and documentation. This means faster repairs, better pricing, and less e-waste. At Hadi’s TechHut, we support these changes and are actively preparing to expand the brands and models we can service, including Apple and Microsoft Surface devices.</p>
